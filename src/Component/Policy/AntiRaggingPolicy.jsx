          The Anti-Ragging Policy at DSEU is a testament to the university's commitment to creating a safe and respectful environment for all students. The university strongly condemns ragging, which includes any form of physical, psychological, or emotional abuse directed toward students. The policy aims to ensure that students can pursue their studies and extracurricular activities without fear or harassment.

          Ragging is considered a criminal offense under Indian law, and DSEU is committed to strictly enforcing this regulation. The university has established a comprehensive approach to prevent ragging, including awareness campaigns, regular workshops, and sensitization programs for both students and staff members. It is mandatory for all incoming students to attend anti-ragging orientation sessions, where they are educated about the legal implications of ragging and the measures in place to combat it.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
          To further strengthen this initiative, DSEU has created a dedicated anti-ragging committee that handles complaints and ensures timely resolution of cases. The committee comprises faculty members, administrative staff, and student representatives, ensuring a diverse and balanced perspective when addressing any incident. The university also maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of harassment, and all reported cases of ragging are dealt with swiftly and transparently.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
          The university encourages students to report any incidents of ragging, either anonymously or through formal channels, without fear of retaliation. To make this process easier, DSEU has set up a confidential online portal where students can submit complaints. The university also provides counseling services to those affected by ragging, offering them a safe space to discuss their experiences and receive support.

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
          The Anti-Ragging Policy extends beyond just punishing the offenders. It seeks to create an environment of mutual respect, kindness, and inclusion. The policy promotes the values of empathy and cooperation, encouraging students to build positive relationships with their peers and to help create a community free from discrimination and intimidation.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
          DSEU's commitment to eradicating ragging is part of a larger effort to foster a culture of safety, equality, and respect. The university believes that every student, regardless of their background, deserves the opportunity to excel in a nurturing and supportive environment. By taking proactive measures against ragging, DSEU is working to ensure that every student can focus on their academic and personal development without fear of abuse or mistreatment.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
          The university will continue to update and refine its Anti-Ragging Policy to stay in line with legal requirements and best practices. DSEU remains committed to fostering a culture of respect, inclusivity, and kindness, and it encourages all members of the community to actively contribute to this goal.
