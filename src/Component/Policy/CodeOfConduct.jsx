            The Code of Conduct at DSEU serves as a foundation for maintaining a respectful, inclusive, and productive academic and social environment for all members of the university community. Every student, faculty member, and staff at DSEU is expected to adhere to these principles in their academic, social, and professional interactions both on and off-campus.

          <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
            Respect and integrity are core values that guide behavior within the university. Every individual is expected to treat others with dignity, ensuring that differences in background, beliefs, and opinions are respected. Any form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying is strictly prohibited and will be dealt with according to university policies.

          <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
            Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that reflects the values of honesty, integrity, and responsibility. Cheating, plagiarism, or any form of academic dishonesty is strictly prohibited. DSEU has a zero-tolerance policy for such behavior, and violators will face appropriate academic and disciplinary actions.

          <p className="my-4 text-gray-600">
            As members of the university community, students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of conduct in both academic and non-academic activities.

            The university encourages students to participate actively in both academic and extracurricular activities. However, it is important that students strike a balance and avoid any activities that interfere with their academic progress or violate the code of conduct. Participation in clubs, societies, or events must be done responsibly, keeping in mind the values of mutual respect and collaboration.

Students found guilty of misconduct will face appropriate disciplinary action, ranging from counseling and warnings to suspension or expulsion, depending on the severity of the offense. The university will also provide an opportunity for students to present their side of the story in a fair and impartial manner.
